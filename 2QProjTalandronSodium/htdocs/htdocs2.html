		animal neglect or animal cruelty, is the infliction

		or harm upon any non-human animal, mostly domesticated
		and some are wild.<p>

		include overt animal abuse, dog and cock fighting

		<h3>HOW TO PREVENT CRUELTY TO ANIMALS</h3>

		<div id="content-body">
			<div class="item1">
				<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">1. Be a responsible pet owner. </p> 
			<div class="item2">
				<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">2. Know about and fulfil the needs of your pet. Don’t just concern yourself with basic needs – give your pet positive experiences that really enhance its well-being.</p>
			<div class="item3">
				<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">3. Be an example of kindness to other pets. Foster a pet that has suffered abandonment. Sadly, many pets are relinquished to shelters for various reasons. Foster homes help these animals to recover and prepare them to move onto a new permanent loving home.</p>
			<div class="item4">	
				<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">4. Intervene if you witness animal cruelty, abuse or neglect. Do what you can to stop someone from mistreating an animal. However, be sensible and don’t put yourself in danger. If necessary, seek help from other witnesses.</p>
			<div class="item5">
				<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">5. Report animal cruelty, abuse or neglect. If you witness any form of animal cruelty, report it to the police or other authorities. Act immediately to prevent further cruelty.
			<div class="item6">
				<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">6. Teach your children to have respect for animals. Set a good example by being respectful towards animals. Show children how to treat animals with love and consideration. Help them to grow up to become the next generation of advocates for animals.</p>
			<div class="item7">
				<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">7. Demand stricter laws for the protection of animals. Stronger animal welfare laws and harsher penalties will lead to fewer cruelty cases.</p>
			<div class="item8">
				<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">8. Shelter an animal in need. You can be the helping hand that an animal need. An animal that has been mistreated needs support, sometimes immediately. You can make a real difference by taking an animal out of a harmful situation.</p>
			<div class="item9">	
				<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">9. Consider that neglect of animals can be closely linked to domestic violence. Animal abuse and domestic abuse are often closely connected. By reporting your suspicions, you may also be helping both the animal in need and the family concerned.(https://www.four-paws.org/campaigns-topics/topics/companion-animals/preventcrueltytoanimals/ways-to-prevent-cruelty-to-animals)</p>
