			Simone Reyes was the breakout star of Oxygen's reality tv show "Running Russell Simmons" and became an overnight hero in the animal rights community.  
			She has been entertainment mogul Russell Simmons’ right hand woman since graduating high school and has often been affectionately referred to as the "Boss" by Simmons himself.  Recently PETA 's Animal Rahat Sanctuary in India was officially given a new name "Simone’s Place" in honor of Simone's tireless dedication to the animal rights cause. (TEDx, 2014)</p>
