			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>In conclusion, animal abuse is wrong because the animals can die, can have many problems, and be affected their whole life. If you have problems and need to deal with them, you should not take it out on the animal. Animal abuse is cruel, should not be done and is a horrible act of violence to commit.(https://thisibelieve.org/essay/78640/, 2010)</p>
			<p>People shouldn’t abuse animals because afterward they can have health problems, behavior problems, and temperamental problems. Most of abused animals have numerous health problems such as heartworm. If pets aren’t treated for heartworm, they may only live 5-7 years for dogs and 2-3 years for cats. Most of abused animals will also have behavior problems such as not being housebroken. Abused animals can also have temper problems like not eating in front of you, and running when you call.(Natalie, Plain City, Ohio, 2010)</p>

			<p>Millions of animals are killed unnecessarily each year for different uses, and in different ways. More than 25 million vertebrate animals are used in animal testing such as monkeys, chimpanzees, beagles and other dogs, cats, rabbits, mice, birds, and farm animals for only the latest hair gel or lipstick. Every year more than 30 million mink, foxes, chinchillas, and other animals are killed on fur farms for things like fur coats, boots, hats rugs, and scarves. 10 billion domesticated land animals are slaughtered in the United States every year, 27 million each day, and 19000 per minute like chicken farms, and puppy mills. Do you think animals should have to suffer everyday like that only for fur coats and lipstick? If people say that we need that food, then we could eat more food that doesn’t involve killing.(Natalie, Plain City, Ohio, 2010)</p>

			<p>Animals who have been abused can be traumatized for the rest of their lives after they have been rescued. They can be afraid to eat with people near. Sometimes if they feel threatened, they may bite, or growl. Sadly, some animals will have to be put down because they will never be able to live a normal life. This shouldn’t be happening because no living thing should have to go through that.(Natalie, Plain City, Ohio, 2010)</p>

			<p>Arguments people use who are for animal testing are that medicine would not be possible without the use of animal testing. Instead of using animals, there could be other alternatives such as something that has the same reactions as humans that is nonliving. Other arguments people use that are for animal abuse are that it was only an animal and they don’t have feelings, but every living animal has feelings. Some people say that since the prisons are overcrowded, we should consider animal abuse less important than other crimes. I think that abusing animals is just as important because they are living, and they have feelings. This crime is just as serious because nothing should have to suffer.(Natalie, Plain City, Ohio, 2010)</p>
